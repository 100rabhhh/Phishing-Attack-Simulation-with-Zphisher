<h1>🛡️ Phishing Attack Simulation with Zphisher 🧑‍💻</h1>

<h2>📋 Introduction</h2>
<p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers use deceptive methods to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as <strong>usernames, passwords,</strong> or <strong>credit card details</strong>. These attacks often exploit social engineering techniques to manipulate human behavior.</p>

<h2>🔍 Characteristics of Phishing</h2>
<ul>
    <li>💬 <strong>Deceptive Communication:</strong> Involves emails or messages that imitate legitimate sources, like banks or service providers.</li>
    <li>🧠 <strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Uses tactics like urgency, fear, or excitement to prompt users into revealing their information.</li>
    <li>📧 <strong>Spoofed Email Addresses:</strong> Attackers use emails that look genuine, making it hard for users to detect the deception.</li>
    <li>🌐 <strong>Fake Websites:</strong> Victims are directed to websites that mimic legitimate ones, aiming to steal their login credentials.</li>
    <li>🔗 <strong>Mismatched URLs:</strong> Phishing links often contain URLs that differ slightly from legitimate sites, tricking users into clicking.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Tool Used: Zphisher</h2>
<p><strong>Zphisher</strong> is an open-source tool widely used for executing phishing attacks. It is known for its user-friendly interface and is considered easier to use than the Social Engineering Toolkit. Zphisher offers templates for more than <strong>33 popular websites</strong> like Facebook, Instagram, Google, Snapchat, and more.</p>

<h3>🚀 Features of Zphisher</h3>
<ul>
    <li>📂 Pre-configured templates for 33+ websites.</li>

    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> 💻 Navigate to the desktop directory and install Zphisher using terminal commands.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> 📂 Navigate to the Zphisher directory and run the tool.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> 🔧 Choose a target website from the list to create a phishing page (e.g., Instagram).</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> 🎯 Select a web template to create the phishing page, such as an Instagram login page for 1000 followers.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> 🌐 Use the tool to generate a link (e.g., using Cloudflared service) and send it to the target.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> 🔗 Once the victim enters their credentials on the phishing page, the details will be reflected in the terminal.</li>
</ol>

<h2>📊 Expected Output</h2>
<p>By using Zphisher, you can simulate phishing attacks and observe how user credentials are captured when they interact with the fake login pages. This helps in understanding the mechanics of phishing and the need for heightened awareness.</p>
